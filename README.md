# JS-Particle-System
A simple particle system implemented in JavaScript
![Example](extras/images/example.gif)

## Running
Either visit the site [here](https://evanpblack.com)
or clone the project and open index.html.
Any reasonably modern browser should work.

## Tests
Running the tests requires Node.

Run the tests by executing:
```bash
node test.js
```
or
```bash
nodejs test.js
```
depending on your platform.

## Rules
The system is made up of _particles_ and _actors_
each with their own rules.

The system operates on ticks. Every animation update is one tick.

Random [Explosion] actors may be generated by the system if that option is set.

### Particles
![Single Particle](extras/images/particle.png "Particle")

Particles are the basic unit of the system. They:
  * Move within the space and collide with other particles & actors
    * When a collision occurs between two particles. One absorbs another
    * When a collision occurs between a particle and an actor the particle will bounce off
    or the specific rules of that actor apply
  * When one particle absorbs another it will grow
    * When a particle exceeds a certain radius, it will burst into smaller particles

### Actors

#### Explode Actor
![Explode Actor](extras/images/explodeActor.png "Explode Actor")

Explode actors explode after making contact with a particle, and a set amount of time passes.
When the actor explodes, any particle in the explosion radius is killed.

#### Kill Actor
![Kill Actor](extras/images/killActor.png "Kill Actor")

Kill actors remove any particle that it comes in contact with.
The actor will remove only a set number of particles before becoming a Null actor.

#### Null Actor
![Null Actor](extras/images/nullActor.png "Null Actor")

Null actors do nothing. Particles will still bounce off of them with no effect.

#### Producer Actor
![Producer Actor](extras/images/producerActor.png "Producer Actor")

Producer actors create new particles that are inserted into the system after a set number of ticks.
Producer actors will continuously produce particles for as long as the simulation is run.
